			<h2 class="section-heading text-center mb-3">What this book aims to
				accomplish…</h2>

			<p class="single-col-max mx-auto">
				This is the first time I’ve written an entire book. I have learned a lot
				in my life, and a lot of it is worth sharing. I am lucky that I was able
				to fulfill this life’s dream of writing a book. In each of our lives, we
				have all experienced occasions of good and bad luck. Sometimes within an
				instant of each other. Each of us is allowed to choose which outcomes we
				focus on, in order to support the attitude we want to have about life.

				So much of our life surrounds luck that I wanted to explore its origins,
				its incarnations in society, and share ways I have seen people respond
				to its results. Some of my close brushes with luck are enclosed, but I
				have also added the stories of many people with whom I have had an
				association. There are also stories of public figures who have
				demonstrated the power of luck in their lives. Whether we be lucky in
				love, sports, or war, there are many stories to share. Enclosed are just
				a few to get you started thinking about whether or not you are lucky.
			</p>

			<h2 class="section-heading text-center mb-3">Luck in our culture…</h2>
			<p class="single-col-max mx-auto">
				Our culture is comprised of people who believe God has preordained
				everything in our world, and other people who believe that all luck is
				human-generated. Perhaps palm readers, crystal ball gazers and
				astrologists ARE tuned into the vibrations of fate. Many of us knock on
				wood, or cross our fingers, carry a lucky charm, or many other things to
				help bring good luck to bear.

				Humans have proven that they will do anything to get a leg up on this
				dangerous affair we call our lives. But when misfortune finally catches
				up to us (and for some of us, that comes sooner rather than later), what
				role might our response to the challenges before us set a course for our
				future fates?

				There is room for the religious here. If you believe in the wonders of a
				Supreme Being, you are very forunate to have been treated so well. Not
				every life form has such a blessed existence. Many religions are built
				around rituals that some have suggested borders on superstition. Even if
				you believe in God, and the Big Bang Theory of our origins, how much
				does God intervene in the daily routines of our lives? At what point
				does God lead you hither and yon? Is he also guiding you when you choose
				to do something regrettable?

				Luck is everywhere. Or is it?

			</h2>
			<div class="author-bio single-col-max mx-auto">
				<p>Brian Hale has been a writer all of his life. His early published
					works included news articles and opinion columns for the Bear Facts
					student newspaper at Bear Creek High School, outside of Denver. This
					spark ignited a career in writing that has included Managing Editor of
					the University of Northern Colorado Mirror, a series of professional
					newspaper reporter jobs with the Vallejo (CA) Times Herald, the Aspen
					(CO) Daily News, the Sixteenth Street Shuttle in Downtown Denver, and
					the Westminster (CO) Window Newspapers. Ultimately that road turned
					off into school public relations work, where he has used his writing
					skills to positive effect for more than 25 years. He has the best wife
					in the world, five young adults who call him Dad, and eleven
					grandchildren. And after waffling a little early on, he would have to
					admit, he does feel very lucky!
